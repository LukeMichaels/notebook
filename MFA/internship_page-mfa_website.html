								"The reason I went to law school in the first place was to find a way—some way—to fight for farmed animals. The work at MFA was ideal for me; I jumped right into hard-hitting investigations, researching the legal issues, and looking for hooks on which to hang factory farms. The feeling when I later saw those same investigations splashed across the internet was electric—at once horrified by the atrocity of it all and yet inspired by the idea that my work was having a direct impact on the national conversation about animals. My internship at MFA gave me deep insights into how to be an effective voice for animals, and I will carry these lessons with me throughout my career as an animal rights attorney."

MFA provided me with an invaluable opportunity to combine my legal knowledge and love of animals to serve as a voice for farmed animals within the legal framework. I also participated in occasional outreach work, which has empowered me with the confidence to promote compassionate living through leafleting and fundraising events back home. My time spent at MFA has not only given me the experience necessary to further my career in the animal rights legal sector, but has also made me a more effective advocate for farmed animals!"

During my winter break as a freshman in college, I had the opportunity to work with an experienced MFA outreach coordinator who helped me channel my anger about factory farming and taught me how to be an effective animal advocate and make a real difference in the lives of thousands, if not millions, of farmed animals. Everything I learned through my internship helped me thrive the following year as a leader of my campus’s animal advocacy group. My internship with MFA gave me the confidence and experience I needed to be a successful animal advocate and has indeed changed my life by leading me to my dream job: a full-time position in MFA’s education department!"
