		<!--CONTENT-START-->
		<p>Thank you for your interest in Mercy For Animals. Your privacy is important to us, and we strive to be transparent in our collection and utilization of your information and data. When we use “MFA,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” this means Mercy For Animals Asia Limited. This Statement operates as both a Personal Information Collection Statement and a Privacy Notice for Mercy For Animals Asia Limited.</p>

		<p>This Statement explains what data we collect from or about volunteers, visitors, and end users (collectively referred to as “you,” “your,” “User,” or “Users”) of our website, including but not limited to mercyforanimals.hk ; our social media platforms; and email or messaging services while communicating with us;  (each an “MFA Site” and collectively, “MFA Sites”). This Statement also explains how we collect data, use it, share it with third parties, and protect it, as well as how you can opt out of various communication channels relating to your data. This also includes data collected about you from platforms managed or owned by third parties.<p>

			<p>This Statement applies only to the MFA Sites maintained by us, and not to any other companies or organizations to which we link or other companies in MFA's group of companies. It specifically addresses our obligations in respect of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (the "Ordinance") of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China ("Hong Kong"). If you access any website, media platform and/or email or messaging service maintained or managed by an entity related to MFA in the same group of companies, the terms of that privacy policy or statement on that channel will apply.</p>

			<p><strong>Please read this Statement carefully. By being a User and using an MFA Site, you are consenting to our collection, use, disclosure, and transfer of your data as described in this Statement and agreeing to the terms herein.  </strong></p>

		<h5 class='mt30'>What data does MFA collect?</h5>

		<p>When you access and use an MFA Site, we may collect the following types of data from you:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>“Personal Data” is data that relates to you and can be used to identify you. Personal Data may include (but is not limited to) your name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, mobile phone number, and demographic information. Personal Data includes Location Data and may include Technical Data.</li>
			<li>“Location Data” is a type of Personal Data that provides information about your geographic location and can be used to locate the device you use to access MFA Sites. Location Data may include a zip or postal code (if any), the location of the device you are using to access an MFA Site (which may be derived from IP-based geolocation), and any other data you or others make available that indicates your location.</li>
			<li>“Technical Data” is data that we collect about your device and your use of MFA Sites and may include your IP address or a unique identifier for a mobile device used to access MFA Sites, web browser, operating system, device model and manufacturer, performance issues, or activity on MFA Sites.</li>
			<li>Other data that you provide to us or we collect about you. This may include the content of your communications with us and contacts through social media channels.</li>
		</ul>
				

		<h5 class='mt30'>How does MFA collect my data?</h5>

		<p>MFA collects data from Users through several points on our MFA Sites. The types of data collected will vary with your particular use of MFA Sites.</p>
		
		<p>This may include the following:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Data you provide to us directly, such as when you submit any of our forms; subscribe to our newsletters, updates, or action alerts; request information about us; volunteer with us; sign up for our email lists; or participate in contests.</li>
			<li>Data automatically collected when you access an MFA Site and when you enable location services on your device when accessing an MFA Site.</li>
			<li>Data collected through digital tools, including but not limited to cookies and pixels.</li>
			<li>Data obtained from other sources, such as from social media networks (for example, when you interact with us by liking us on Facebook or Instagram or following us on Twitter), other publicly available sources and databases, data aggregators, marketing companies, or other third parties. For example, if you are on a third-party website and request information from us, that website may send us your contact information.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>By submitting your data through these various channels, you consent to receiving communications and content from MFA, including but not limited to communications relating to important developments in the animal rights movement, volunteer opportunities, or similar activities.</p>

		<p>Please follow the instructions contained in this Statement to withdraw consent (opt out) or to limit our ability to receive certain types of data through our digital tools or the tools of our third-party partners.</p>

		<h5 class='mt30'>Cookies and Pixels</h5>

		<p>A “cookie” is a small file placed on your device’s hard drive that collects and stores data about your equipment, preferences, and browsing patterns. MFA uses cookies to remember some details about Users, including but not limited to language preferences. MFA also relies on data obtained from cookies to perform ongoing analysis and improve MFA Sites and to tailor our content to your interests. MFA may use both first-party cookies, as set by us, and third-party cookies, from a domain other than the MFA Site domain you are visiting. These cookies may allow us to obtain basic data, such as your Location Data, the way that you reached the MFA Site, and your activity on the MFA Site. You can set your internet browser settings to stop accepting new cookies, notice when you receive a new cookie, disable existing cookies, or omit images. The opt-out will apply only to the browser you are using when you elect to opt out of cookies. Note that without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of all features of MFA Sites. You also may not receive advertising or other offers from us that are relevant to your interests and needs. Pixels (also referred to as web beacons, clear GIFs, or pixel tags) are transparent images used in tandem with cookies that enable us, our vendors, or other business partners to record a User’s actions. We use these to count and track Users who have visited pages, to perform ongoing analysis, to improve MFA Sites, and for other statistical purposes.</p>

		<h5 class='mt30'>Google Analytics</h5>

		<p>We use Google Analytics to help us understand how users engage with MFA Sites. Google Analytics uses cookies to track your interactions with MFA Sites and then collects that data and reports it to us, without individually identifying Users. This data helps us improve MFA Sites.</p>

		<h5 class='mt30'>How does MFA use my data? </h5>

		<p>We may use your data for the following purposes:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><em>Communication with you:</em> We may contact you to offer information and updates about MFA, MFA Sites, and our campaigns and programs; send you information and material for events, activities,  and volunteer opportunities relating to important developments in the animal rights movement, as well as plant-based eating tips.</li>
			<li><em>Text messaging:</em> We may use your mobile phone number to send you text messages about MFA, donation opportunities, events, and campaigns.</li>
			<li><em>Improving MFA Sites:</em> We may use your data to help us improve the content and functionality of MFA Sites and to facilitate and enhance MFA Site features that require User input, whether this data is submitted directly by a User or collected through technologies such as cookies.</li>
			<li><em>Improving campaigns and programs through planning, analysis, and other operational processes:</em> By collecting User data, we are able to measure interest in our various campaigns and programs and use this information to better serve you and help make our advocacy efforts more effective. We may also use this data to recognize when a User has participated in a campaign and send you information about campaigns that may be of interest to you.</li>
			<li><em>Legal purposes:</em> We will use your data when required by law, regulation, court order, warrant, or similar legal process or if necessary to assert our rights or protect our assets.</li>
			<li><em>Sharing of data:</em> We may share your name, address, and histories with other charities and organizations (and third-party vendors may do so on our behalf) so that the other charities and organizations can contact you for marketing purposes. You can opt out of sharing your Personal Data at any time by emailing us at <a href="mailto:dataprivacy@mercyforanimals.org">dataprivacy@mercyforanimals.org</a> or by checking the do-not-share box that may be contained in certain emails to you.  We may also share your data internally, with other MFA entities (e.g. Mercy For Animals, Inc.) and with third parties, including but not limited to our affiliated partners, vendors, and contractors including third parties (within or outside Hong Kong) that help us operate and maintain the MFA Sites. MFA uses various third parties for certain services, such as to process online forms, capture data, and produce analytics. You can opt out of sharing your Personal Data at any time by emailing us at [<a href="mailto:info-hk@mercyforanimals.org">info-hk@mercyforanimals.org</a> / <a href="mailto:dataprivacy@mercyforanimals.org">dataprivacy@mercyforanimals.org</a>].<br><br>
					We will not sell your Personal Data, and we will not share your Personal Data with any third parties except in the circumstances set out elsewhere in this Statement.</li>
			<li><em>De-identified data:</em> We may also de-identify your data or aggregate your data with that of other Users. This de-identified data is not Personal Data because it cannot be used to identify you and may be used by us for any lawful purpose.
			<li><em>Other purposes:</em> In addition to the foregoing, we may use your data for any other reason that we tell you when we collect it or in an authorization or consent.</li>
		</ul>

		<h5 class='mt30'>How long is my data retained?</h5>

		<p>MFA retains data for as long as it is necessary to fulfil the original purpose for which it was collected, or any directly related purpose, unless the data are retained for a longer period in order to satisfy any applicable statutory or contractual obligations. Records of communications by email will be deleted after 3 months.</p>

		<h5 class='mt30'>How can I opt out or access or correct my Personal Data?</h5>

		<p>We respect our Users’ choices and control over their data. You may opt out of email communications from us by clicking the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the emails or by emailing us at [<a href="mailto:info-hk@mercyforanimals.org">info-hk@mercyforanimals.org</a> / <a href="mailto:dataprivacy@mercyforanimals.org">dataprivacy@mercyforanimals.org</a>]. MFA will respond to all requests to provide records of available data, correct erroneous data, or remove Personal Data within a reasonable period of time and in any event within the period required by the Ordinance. Such requests can be submitted by email to [<a href="mailto:info-hk@mercyforanimals.org">info-hk@mercyforanimals.org</a> / <a href="mailto:dataprivacy@mercyforanimals.org">dataprivacy@mercyforanimals.org</a>]. </p>

		<h5 class='mt30'>How is my data protected?</h5>

		<p>MFA uses security protocols to ensure the privacy of your data. MFA maintains data-security measures in line with current industry standards for MFA Sites to protect the Personal Data under its control against unauthorized access and disclosure. These measures include the implementation of reasonable industry-recommended technical, physical, and administrative data-security safeguards. Please keep in mind, however, that no data transmitted over the internet is 100 percent secure, and any data disclosed online can potentially be collected and used by parties other than the intended recipient. In visiting and/or using any MFA Site you agree that you will maintain all reasonably practicable security measures and vigilance to protect your data.</p>

		<h5 class='mt30'>Other Locations</h5>

		<p>Your data collected through MFA Sites may be transferred, stored and processed in Hong Kong, the United States or any other country in which  MFA or other MFA entities and their affiliates or service providers maintain facilities. If you are located in other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from Hong Kong law, please note that we may transfer your data, including Personal Data, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data-protection laws as your jurisdiction, and note that you consent to the transfer of data to the United States or any other country in which MFA or its affiliated partners, contractors, or vendors maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of data about you as described in this Statement.</p>

		<p>Please follow the instructions contained in this Statement to withdraw consent, to limit our ability to receive certain types of data through our digital tools or the tools of our third-party partners, or to request deletion of your Personal Data.</p>

		<h5 class='mt30'>Other Sites</h5>

		<p>One or more MFA Sites may contain links to other sites, products, and services that are external and not owned or controlled by us. We are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by or content of such other sites, products, and services. We encourage you to be aware when you leave MFA Sites and to review the privacy policies and/or statements of any other MFA entities, third-party websites or services, as you will be subject to their policies, rules, and terms.</p>

		<h5 class='mt30'>Changes to This Statement</h5>

		<p>We may change this Statement at any time. Changes will be effective immediately upon posting. Please check this Statement regularly to ensure that you are aware of any changes. Your visit to or use of any MFA Site after changes to this Statement have been made means you have accepted the changes. If you do not agree with the changes, immediately stop visiting or using MFA Sites.</p>
