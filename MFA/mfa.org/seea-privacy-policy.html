		</ul>

		<p>By submitting your information through these various channels, you consent to our collection, use and/or disclosure of your personal data for the purposes specified below, including for receiving communications and content from MFA SEEA, including but not limited to communications relating to important developments in the animal rights movement, volunteer opportunities, demonstrations, or similar activities.

		<p>We will not collect, use, or disclose personal data about you unless (a) you have given, or are deemed to have given, your consent under the Personal Data Protection Act of Singapore and any other law applicable to the collection, use, or disclosure, as the case may be, or (b) the collection, use, or disclosure, as the case may be, without your consent is as required or authorized under the Personal Data Protection Act of Singapore and any other applicable law.</p>

		<h5 class='mt30'>Cookies and Pixels</h5>

		<p>A “cookie” is a small file placed on your device’s hard drive that collects and stores information about your equipment, preferences, and browsing patterns. MFA SEEA uses cookies to remember some details about Users, including but not limited to language preferences. MFA SEEA also relies on information obtained from cookies to perform ongoing analysis and improve MFA SEEA Sites and to tailor our content to your interests. MFA SEEA may use both first-party cookies, as set by us, and third-party cookies, from a domain other than the MFA SEEA Site domain you are visiting. These cookies may allow us to obtain basic information, such as your Location Information, the way that you reached the MFA SEEA Site, and your activity on the MFA SEEA Site. You can set your internet browser settings to stop accepting new cookies, notice when you receive a new cookie, disable existing cookies, or omit images. The opt-out will apply only to the browser you are using when you elect to opt out of cookies. Note that without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of all features of MFA SEEA Sites or other websites owned or managed by MFA. You also may not receive advertising or other offers from us that are relevant to your interests and needs. Pixels (also referred to as web beacons, clear GIFs, or pixel tags) are transparent images used in tandem with cookies that enable us, our vendors, or other business partners to record a User’s actions. We use these to count and track Users who have visited pages, to perform ongoing analysis, to improve MFA SEEA Sites, and for other statistical purposes.</p>

		<h5 class='mt30'>Google Analytics</h5>

		<p>We use Google Analytics to help us understand how Users engage with MFA SEEA Sites.

		<h5 class='mt30'>Transfer of personal data outside Singapore</h5>

		<p>When we transfer your information to a country or territory outside Singapore, we do so only if we have taken appropriate steps to ascertain whether, and to ensure that, the recipient of the personal data is bound by legally enforceable obligations to provide the transferred personal data a standard of protection that is at least comparable to the protection under the Personal Data Protection Act of Singapore.</p>
