### I. Plan
  - Interview users  
  - Write a manifesto (or creative brief)  
  - [Good example](https://www.uie.com/articles/short_form_creative_brief)  


### II. Inventory
#### Interface Inventory
  - It’s good to take inventory of UI elements from time-to-time, checking for consistency.  
  - When working on an existing project, it’s good to start by checking the inventory.  

#### Performance Budget
  - [good resource to check page speed](webpagetest.org)  
  - it’s good to also test the speed of competitors in the space and compare.  
  - A good goal is to shave 20% off the fastest time you can discover.  
  - Target time (in seconds) x 96 kb/s = Target weight (in kb)  
  - [provides average weights of web elements](http://httparchive.org provides average weights of web elements)  

#### Visual Inventory
  - This is a mood board of screen grabs that can be shown to the client with short   
    descriptions next to them.
  - The idea is that this approach provides the same fidelity of a comp, but take much 
    less time to produce.  
  - [Examples](http://danielmall.com/articles/visual-inventory/)  

## III. Sketch
  - Generate and refine ideas quickly.  
  - Listen for words repeated by the client or during a kick off meeting.  

### Element Collage
  - The element collage should include the major elements of the webpage, but not constrained to exactly where they will fit on the page.  
  - This give a good overview of how a site will look and function without being restricted to a design comp.  
  - A design comp only captures one moment, an element collage provides snapshots of the full experience.

  - [useful resource for showing typography](http://typecast.com)  
  
### Prototyping
  - Each prototype should take < 1 hour to make  
  - The first prototype should be something that anyone can build.  
  - Build ugly  
  
## IV. Assemble
