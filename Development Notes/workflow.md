I. Plan
II. Inventory


### I. Plan
- Interview users

- Write a manifesto (or creative brief) 
  - Good example https://www.uie.com/articles/short_form_creative_brief


### II. Inventory
#### Interface Inventory
  - It’s good to take inventory of UI elements from time-to-time, checking for consistency.
  - When working on an existing project, it’s good to start by checking the inventory.

#### Performance Budget
  - webpagetest.org is a good resource to check page speed.
  - it’s good to also test the speed of competitors in the space and compare.
  - A good goal is to shave 20% off the fastest time you can discover.
  - Target time (in seconds) x 96 kb/s = Target weight (in kb)
  - http://httparchive.org provides average weights of web elements.

#### Visual Inventory
  - This is a mood board of screen grabs that can be shown to the client with short 
    descriptions next to them.
  - The idea is that this approach provides the same fidelity of a comp, but take much 
    less time to produce.
  - Examples http://danielmall.com/articles/visual-inventory/

#### Sketch
  - Generate and refine ideas quickly.
  - Listen for words repeated by the client or during a kick off meeting.
