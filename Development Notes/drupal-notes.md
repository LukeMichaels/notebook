## II.   The parts of a Drupal Project:

### Code:
  - Drupal Core - Drupal files that form the basis of the CMS (Content Management System) sites folder - your website
  - Modules - folders of code that add features and tools to add to your website
  - Themes - folders of code and images that control the look and feel of the website

### Database:  
  - Content - things like images, blog posts and pages like "About" and "Contact"  
  - Configuration - anything else, like the name of the site, its slogan, etc.  


  - Only modify code in the `sites` folder, all else is core and should not be edited.
  - The themes folder is for modifying appearance.
  - The modules folder contains various plugins.
